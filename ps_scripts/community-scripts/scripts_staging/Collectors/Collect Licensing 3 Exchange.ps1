.SYNOPSIS
    Retrieves the number of Exchange mailboxes for licensing compliance reporting.

.DESCRIPTION
    This script uses the Exchange Management Shell to determine the number of mailboxes 
    associated with a specific Exchange Server CAL (Client Access License), 
    such as the "Exchange Server 2016 Standard CAL." It ensures the Exchange snap-in is loaded and 
    captures the mailbox count for licensing purposes.

    Extend support to handle multiple CAL types dynamically.
