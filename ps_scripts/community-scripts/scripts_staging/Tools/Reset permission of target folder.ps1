.SYNOPSIS
    This script resets folder and file permissions by applying inherited permissions from the target folder and checks for permission mismatches across subfolders and files.

.DESCRIPTION
    The script retrieves the target folder path from an environment variable and ensures the folder exists. 
    It then gets the ACL (Access Control List) of the target folder and applies the inherited permissions to all subfolders and files within the target folder. 
    It also compares the ACLs of child items with their parent folder to identify permission mismatches. The script includes two main functions:
    - `Set-InheritedPermissions`: Resets permissions and inheritance on a folder or file.
    - `Compare-Acls`: Compares the ACLs of a child item with its parent to identify mismatched permissions.

.EXAMPLE 
    TARGETFOLDER=C:\TargetFolder
