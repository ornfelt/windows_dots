.SYNOPSIS
    This script checks if an admin user exists, and if so, changes the password and ensures the user is added to the Administrators group. 

.DESCRIPTION
    The script retrieves the admin username from the environment variable `adminusername` and generates a passphrase. 
    It checks if the user exists on the system, then either updates the password for an existing user or creates the user if they do not exist. 
    It also ensures the user is added to both the 'Administrators' and 'Administrateurs' local groups and disables the password expiration.

.PARAMETER adminusername
    The environment variable `adminusername` should be set with the desired username for the admin account.

.EXAMPLE
    adminusername=adminUser
