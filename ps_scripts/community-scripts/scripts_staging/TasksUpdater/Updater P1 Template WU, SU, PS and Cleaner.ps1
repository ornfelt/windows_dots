.SYNOPSIS
    Poor's man WSUS/SCCM part 1
    This PowerShell script is the first part of a multi-phase automation process designed to manage and schedule system maintenance tasks based on device attributes, primarily focusing on the hostname. 
    In this phase, the script outputs the device's category (e.g., DC, DB, APP) and odd/even status, as well as generates initial schedules for updates and cleanup tasks, which will be used in the subsequent parts of the process to refine and manage these tasks based on device-specific criteria.

.DESCRIPTION
    The script begins by checking the value of the environment variable `CurrentSchedules` to determine if the script should be executed or skipped. 
    If the variable contains the word "skip" or the environment variable `forcechange` is not set to "true", the script exits early. 
    If the script proceeds, it retrieves and outputs the hostname of the device and the current date.

    The device's category is determined by matching the hostname against predefined keywords for various roles such as Domain Controller (DC), Database Server (DB), Application Server (APP), Remote Desktop Server (RDS), and Exchange Server. 
    The script then calculates the sum of digits in the hostname to classify the device as "Odd" or "Even", which will influence the update schedule.

    Based on the device's category and odd/even classification, the script assigns specific weeks and days for key maintenance tasks:
    * Windows updates
    * Software updates
    * PowerShell module updates
    * Temporary file cleanup

    The script outputs these initial schedules, using the last digit of the hostname to determine the exact time for each task in a `HH:mm:ss` format. 
    These schedules will serve as a foundation for the next phase of automation.

.EXEMPLE
    CurrentSchedules={{agent.SchedulesTemplate}}
