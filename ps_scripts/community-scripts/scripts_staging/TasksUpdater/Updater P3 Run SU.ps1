.SYNOPSIS
    Poor's man WSUS/SCCM part 3 - Software Update
    This PowerShell script is the third phase of a multi-part automation process. 
    It manages the daily software update process, identifies pending system reboots, and schedules a reboot if necessary after completing updates.
    It is designed to run daily to ensure all modules are up to date and log the update process for tracking purposes.

.DESCRIPTION
    This script is designed to ensure systems are kept up to date with minimal disruption:
    * Run daily
    * Uses the `Updater P3.5 Schedules parser` snippet to determine the current task's schedule.
    * Logs all actions and outputs through the `Logging` snippet for troubleshooting and auditing.
    * Leverages Chocolatey to identify outdated software packages and upgrades them.
    * Automatically schedules a reboot if required, using the parsed time from the schedule.

.EXAMPLE
    Schedules={{agent.Schedules}}
    Company_folder_path={{global.Company_folder_path}}

.CHANGELOG 
    24.10.24 SAN Conditional reboot added and removed the reboot snippet; this part is going to be canned.
    28.10.24 SAN Added even flag for reboot.
    04.11.24 SAN More verbose output for the reboot to help troubleshoot.
    27.11.24 SAN More verbose output for the reboot and fixed some lack of logs from the Chocolatey commands.
    27.11.24 SAN Disabled file rename check due to issues.
    13.12.24 SAN Split logging from parser.

.TODO
    Fix rename?
