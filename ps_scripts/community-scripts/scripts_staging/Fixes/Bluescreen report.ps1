.SYNOPSIS
    This script automates the process of installing Bluescreen Viewer, running it to generate a crash log, and uploading Minidump files to a Nextcloud WebDAV server.

.DESCRIPTION
    The script installs Bluescreen Viewer using Chocolatey, runs it to generate a crash log, and displays the log in the terminal.
    It then checks the local Minidump folder for dump files, uploads them to a specified Nextcloud WebDAV URL, and renames them with a "_sent" suffix after a successful upload.

    NEXTCLOUD_TOKEN=SHARETOKEN
