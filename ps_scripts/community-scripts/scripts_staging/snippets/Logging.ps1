.SYNOPSIS
    This script performs logging and log rotation for a specified part name. 
    It checks for required environment variables, creates the log folder if necessary, 
    starts logging to a timestamped log file, and registers an event to stop logging and rotate logs upon script exit.

.DESCRIPTION
    The script first checks whether the `$PartName` variable is set. If it is not, the script terminates with a warning. 
    Then, it retrieves the base folder path from the environment variable `$env:Company_folder_path`. If this environment variable is not set, the script exits with a warning.

    The script attempts to create the log folder (if it doesn't already exist) at the path derived from `$env:Company_folder_path\logs`. 
    If the folder creation fails, it exits with an error.

    The script then generates a log file name based on the part name and a timestamp. A logging session is initiated.

    A log rotation function is defined, which removes log files older than a specified number of days based on the last write time. 

    Finally, the script registers an event to stop the logging session and rotate the logs when the PowerShell session exits. 

.EXEMPLE
    $PartName = Name (set in main script)
    Company_folder_path={{global.Company_folder_path}}
