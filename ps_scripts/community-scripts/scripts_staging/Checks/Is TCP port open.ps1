<#
.SYNOPSIS
    Checks if a TCP port is open on the local machine based on the environment variable "TCP_PORT".

.DESCRIPTION
    This script checks if the TCP port defined by the environment variable "TCP_PORT" is open using the `Test-NetConnection` cmdlet. 
    If `Test-NetConnection` is not available, it falls back to using the `System.Net.Sockets.TcpClient` class to perform the check.
    Additionally, it will display the executable and process information that is holding the port open.
    If the application is linked to a service, the service name and status will be displayed.
    The script will exit with a status code of 1 if the port is closed or if the environment variable is not set.

.EXEMPLE
    TCP_PORT=3435
