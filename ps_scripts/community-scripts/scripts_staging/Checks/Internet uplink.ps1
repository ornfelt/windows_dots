.SYNOPSIS
    Tests connectivity to a predefined list of IP addresses either randomly or all at once.

.DESCRIPTION
    This script checks network connectivity by pinging a list of predefined IP addresses. 
    The user can choose to test all the IP addresses or a randomly selected one.
    If a ping fails, the script exits with a status code of 1.

.PARAMETER TestAll
    A switch parameter to test all IP addresses in the list.
    If not specified, the script selects a random IP address for testing.

.EXAMPLE
    -TestAll
