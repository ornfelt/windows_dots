.SYNOPSIS
    Monitors DFS Replication backlog and generates status based on the file count in the backlog for specified replication groups.

.DESCRIPTION
    This script checks the DFS Replication backlog for specified replication groups using WMI queries and the 'dfsrdiag' command. 
    It generates success, warning, or error statuses based on the backlog file count, helping to monitor replication health.

.PARAMETER ReplicationGroupList
    An array of DFS Replication Group names to monitor. If not specified, all groups will be checked.
    This can be specified through the variable `ReplicationGroupList`.

.EXAMPLE
    ReplicationGroupList = @("Group1", "Group2")
    This will check the backlog for "Group1" and "Group2" replication groups.
